# surfs_up

##Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round in Oahu.  In order to determine this, temperature data was retrieved for the months of June and December.  This was completed by using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to take the measurements from the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all temperate data for the months of June and December to convert into a list, create a dataframe, and then generate teh summary statistics for both months.
